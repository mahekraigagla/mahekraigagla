👋 Hi, I’m @Mahe kRaigagla!
👀 I’m passionate about coding and creativity (the two keys to unlocking endless possibilities).
🌱 I’m currently diving into the world of web development and finding innovative solutions.
💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects that inspire and uplift others (and maybe add a dash of fun!).
📫 How to reach me: You can send a carrier pigeon, but if you prefer modern methods, drop me an email at mraigagla1@gmail.com! (I promise I’ll try to respond). 😉
😄 Pronouns: She/Her
⚡ Fun fact: I once attempted to create a program that generates poetry. Let’s just say it produced some interesting verses! ✍️✨
